# Introduction

The Maryj API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

We support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
